## Spring 2025
## Overview ##

This is a team and project-based course on video game design and development using Unreal Engine. Topics covered will include geometric modeling, game physics and AI, shader programming, and software and engineering practices within the game industry. The central focus of the course will be the design and development of a game by teams of 3 to 5 students. 

## Communication ##

**It is your responsibility to stay engaged with the course...at a minimum this means:**
  1. **Checking CampusWire every Tuesday for weekly announcements**
  2. **Watching the [Schedule page](https://illinois-cs415.github.io/schedule) for assignment due dates**
  3. **Engaging with your project group and contributing significantly to the project.<br/>
       Failure to do so can result in failure in the course.** 

  You should also attend the live discussions...but we understand that conflicts come up and will not make attendance mandatory. 
  You definitely should watch all the posted videos in order to successfully complete the Homework and Exams.

+ **There is no live lecture on Thursday.** Pre-recorded lectures and other contennt will be posted on Thursdays. You are expected to watch these and/or read the posted content. 

#### Development Resources ####

You will need to have access to a computer capable of running Unreal Engine. <br/>
+ You can test your computer by downloading and installing Unreal vesion 5.4.3 from [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) <br/>
+ You should choose the publishing license. 

If your computer is not capable of running Unreal, see the [Resources page](https://illinois-cs415.github.io/resources) for ways you can find a computer on campus running Unreal Engine.

## Assessments ##

Assigned work will include 6 homework assignments, 2 exams, 3 programming assignments, and a final project.

#### Homework ####
There will be 6 short homework assignments on PrairieLearn. This homework will be based on the lecture material. 
+ You should budget an hour to complete a homework assignment.
+ Each homework can be retaken as many times as you wish for full credit.
+ The homework is open web. 
+ Each homework will be available for 2 weeks at full credit. 
+ After that week, the homework can be submitted for half credit.

#### Exams ####

There will be two exams. They will:
+ Be on PrairieLearn
+ Be very much like the homework...sometimes will even have the same questions!
+ Have a strict time limit of an hour 
+ **Will be scheduled for a morning and evening (conflict) session on the exam date**.
+ Are open web
+ The questions are randomized...no two exams will be the same.
+ **You should not collaborate or share information about the exams.**<br/>
  **The sanction for doing so will be failure in the course**  

 **The exam dates are:<br/>**
 + **March 11 11am to noon (conflict at March 11 8pm to 9pm)**
 + **May 6 11am to noon (conflict at May 6 8pm to 9pm)**
 
 The exams are not meant to be difficult...do the homework to prepare and you will be fine.<br/>
 There's really no need to cheat.

#### Programming Assignments ####
There will be 3 machine problems (MPs) that will serve as an introduction to Unreal. You will use Unreal 5 and Blueprints to implement the MPs.

#### Project ####
The course project will be team-based with teams of 3 to 5 people working on a project. You will have a choice of what to implement, but your proposed project is expected to be related to game development in some way...typically it should be a game. The grading citeria and development process are described on the Project page.

#### Gen AI and Plagiarism Policy ####

For the Programming Assignments and Project we will have the following the rules:
+ **DO NOT SUBMIT SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME AS YOUR OWN** The penalty for doing so will be **failure in the course**.
+ If you are in a situation that makes completing the assignment difficult (e.g. health reasons, interview schedule, whatvere) **contact the course staff on campuswire at least 3 days before the due date and we can come up with a plan to complete thge work that does not involve plagiarism.**
+ You can use assets, even code, created by others for the project but you must tell us did and achknowledge the original author or source and **the project as a whole needs to be substantially new work by your team.**
+ You can use Gen AI tools for the project but you must tell us did and achknowledge the source and **the project as a whole needs to be substantially new work by your team.**   

#### 4 Credit Option ####

Students taking the course for 4 credits will complete an extra programming assignment using an alternative game engine such as Unity or Godot.

## Grades ##
We will post grades on [Canvas](https://canvas.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 0  | 1%  | 1% |
| MP 1 | 9% | 4% | 
| MP 2 | 15% | 10% |   
| Homework|15%| 10%|
| Exam 1 | 12% | 12%|
| Exam 2 | 12% | 12%|
| Project | 36% | 36% |
| 4 Credit MP | NA | 15% |

The course grade cutoffs can be expected to be:

|Percentage lower bound | Grade |
| ----- | ------ |
| 93% | A |
| 90% | A- |
| 87% | B+ |
| 83% | B |
| 80% | B- |

| 73% | C |
| 70% | C- |
| 67% | D+ |
| 63% | D |
| 60% | D- |
| 0%  | F  |

### How to get an A+ ###
To earn an A+, you must earn an A numerically and do something that stands out as exceptional to the course staff. For example, you could do an exceptional job at answering questions on Campuswire or you could do a great job at asking good questions on Campuswire or your submitted game could truly exceptional in terms of creativity or gameplay.
