### Late Work ###
Machine problems submitted after the due date lose 10% of the total assignment value per day. In exceptional circumstances where extension may be reasonable (illness, family emergency etc.) arrangement must be made with the instructor.

### Collaboration ###
You should collaborate on the MPs during the design process...you absolutely can figure out how to implement things together. If you work on MPs together, document your collaborators in the author comment in your submitted code.

You should type the code in yourself. You should not copy code verbatim from each other or the web. You can reuse code from the course website. Each MP has a creative component and we expect that your MP will look noticeably different than other submissions. The penalty for egregious plagiarism will be a 0 on the assignment and loss of 1 full letter grade from the total course grade. 

## Regrade Requests ##
To submit a regrade request:

- Create a post on CampusWire with the category `regrade` and select `Post to instructors and TAs`.
- Include a brief explanation of why you think your grade is incorrect.
- You must submit regrade requests within one week after we release grades on a given assignment.

## Academic Integrity ##
You should be familiar with the Student Code [definitions on academic integrity](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/). We expect you to abide by them.
