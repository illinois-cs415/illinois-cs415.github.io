# Game Engines

Virtually all current game development relies on **game engines**. A game engine can be thought of as a development environment and integrated set of libraries. The engine allows the reuse of performant and tested code across multiple game titles. This way, code for 3D rendering and physics simulation and other game requirements does not have to be written from scratch for each game. Moreover, it allows people who are not, for example, graphics programmers to be able to create games that are visually impressive. 

## Unreal Engine

Unreal is one of the most popular game engines. It is free to use for non-commercial projects. It is also open source. Despite this, it is a state-of-the-art engine capable of creating a AAA game title. 

Unreal is also very popular for commercial projects. It's licensing terms are generally considered very fair...you can find those at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_5). You can a list of some commercial titles that use Unreal at this [link](https://gamerant.com/all-confirmed-unreal-engine-5-games/).

## Your First Assignment

If you have access to a personal computer (laptop or otherwise), you will need to determine if it is capable of running Unreal. To do so, you will install Unreal Engine, try to work through a tutorial that takes about one hour and then **let us know via a survey if you have a computer that can run Unreal.** 

### Which Version?

**You should use Unreal 5.0 or above for this course.** The exact version is not terribly important. We would recommend using Unreal 5.5, the latest version, if possible.
