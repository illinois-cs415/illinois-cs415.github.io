# Final Project
Your task is to as a team create a video game. Your grade for this project is made up of three major deliverables and team meetings with your assigned project mentor every two weeks. The details, dates, and list of documents to be turned in for each are below.


You can find all document templates needed for the project at the [Course Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G6Jt7JKCdktTcALsBy6WtPQnr2JSAeT5?usp=sharing)


The final project is worth a total of **100 points**. Each subsection will be graded *per group*, except for the peer evaluation section. 




## Discovery (10 of points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM October 19**

This is the first project milestone. You will submit completed versions of the project documents in the [Final Project Documents Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G6Jt7JKCdktTcALsBy6WtPQnr2JSAeT5?usp=sharing). You may wish to review Dan Cermak's guest lectures on Game Design:
[ ![lecture](/img/gd.png){:width="400px"}](https://illinois-cs415.github.io/schedule)

The Discovery section is graded on completeness and correctness. Points will be taken off for incorrect submissions (such as missing documents) or for incorrectly filled sections. In particular:

1. Note that each vision canvas section has specific meanings and phrasings. 
2. Try to break down the tasks as much as possible, and consider absolutely everything you may need to implement your vision.
3. The summary should give an idea of what the game *is* and what the player *does*. Avoid explaining implementations or precise technical details. 
4.  Initial collaboration plan should clearly describe how you will distribute features and work together on the project including what version control method you will be using. This only needs to be 3 to 5 sentences.

**You can change your design and other plans as the project progresses.** You do not need to go into great detail about how things will be implemented or exhaustively list game features. The most important thing is just to have a vision and a plan that we can discuss.

**Still to come: We will post examples of filled out documents here on Oct. 12**


## Mid Project Meeting (5 points)
Before the Alpha and Final submission due dates, groups will meet with their assigned TAs **one time** to discuss their progress, challenges, and feedback. Groups will be graded on:


1. **Attendance.** A majority of group members must attend.
2. **Progress.** The group should make significant progress since Discovery for the first meeting. 
3. **Feedback.** For the meeting, groups should take into consideration feedback given for their Discovery grade. Groups should update their vision canvases, summaries, and technical design documents periodically to reflect this feedback and any changes in design.

**Week of meetings: Oct. 31- Nov. 4**

**A live demonstration of some code is expected.** Feedback will be given during these meetings, and this feedback should be incorporated to the alpha and final submissions.


## Alpha (30 points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM November 18**


The Alpha submission focuses on the completeness of your game and the implementation of high-priority features. Think of it as a rough draft. We are looking for a demonstration of your gameâ€™s features and gameplay. Visuals, sound, and minor mechanics do not have to be finalized. Additionally, we want groups to update their design documents to reflect the changes made to the game so far.


### Documentation: 5 Points


Groups must update their summaries, vision canvas, and technical design documents to reflect feedback given from Discovery and the first mid-project meeting. It should also include any changes to design made throughout the project.


### Implementation: 20 Points


Groups must implement at least a majority of their core features. Some minor bugs are allowed but the game must be playable. The gameplay provided in the Alpha submission must give the player an idea of what the final game will play like.

### Live Demonstration: 5 Points

You must demo your alpha submission live or on zoom. You can choose to make and play a video if you choose to use zoom. The demo can be short but should show all the features of your gameplay implemented to date. **You need to schedule a time to demo with your assigned TA sometime during the week of Nov 14-18**


## Final Submission (40 points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM Dec. 7th**


Your final project submission. A version of your game with at least all the high priority features done and in a fully playable state. The deliverables for your final submission are the code for the project and a video walking us through the work you have completed. You should also submit an updated version of your discovery documents with any changes you might have made since alpha.

**Still to Come: A Detailed Rubric of Grading Criteria Will be Posted Here by Oct. 19th** 


## Peer Evaluation (10 points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM Dec. 7th** 


In the first project milestone along with the summary of your project proposal, your team will need to submit a brief summary (3-5 sentences) describing how your group plans to split up work and collaborate. Halfway through the project timeline, each individual team member will be asked to submit a brief peer evaluation form of their team members - through this form, you will also have the opportunity to reflect on your team's progress and style of working so far; a TA may reach out to follow up on the responses or provide any guidance if questions/concerns are expressed. At the end of the project, each individual team member will submit a brief peer evaluation form of their team members. 


## In-person Demo (5 points)
**Due date: Dec. 8 through Dec 16**
It is a University requirement that the project be demonstrated in person to your project mentor (or another staff member if the mentor is unavailable). Your mentor will schedule a demonstration time and location with your team, and it will take place sometime during finals week. We would like all team members to attend. If that is logistically problematic please contact the course instructor at shaffer1@illinois.edu to discuss an alternative arrangement in terms of time or attendance. The grade for the demonstration is based solely on showing up and demoing. There is no assessment of the quality of demonstration.
