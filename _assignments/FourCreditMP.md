For your 4-credit project you have two options:

1. Create a short tutorial on some aspect of using Unreal Engine. This should be in the form of a short video, about 5 to 10 minutes long. It can be on any feature of Unreal. It can be on a topic covered iun class, but it should not simply repeat information already provided in class. In particular, topics in the following categories would good choices:
+ Using AI in Unreal
+ Physics in Unreal
+ Animation in Unreal
+ Developing with C++ in Unreal

2. A project you propose on anything game-related. This should have roughly the same level of complexity and effort at MP1.

### Proposing a Topic ###

Please propose a topic using a CampusWire post to `instructors and TAs` with the subject `4 Credit Assignment`. Just very, very briefly list your tutorial topic or alternate proposal. Please do this by April 20th at the latest.  

## Submission ###

On Canvas, please submit a **zipped** folder the following:
+ Any slides used in the tutorial (or a link to them). I you don't use slides, submit a transcript of your talk.
+ A video file of your tutorial (in mp4 format) or link to the video.
+ Any example code or project used in the tutorial...or a link to them.

If you do a non-tutorial project, submit those materials in the zipped folder.

**For this assignment ignore the submission instructions in the next section**
