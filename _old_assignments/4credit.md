## What is the 4 Credit Assignment About?
Taking the course for an extra credit hour requires the completion of an extra project in addition to the course project done by the entire class. 
This semester, the 4 credit is to design and make a simple game **NOT** using Unreal. We suggest using either Unity or Godot but
you can use another technology if you wish. If you are not familiar with those other two engines, take some time to look over the documentation for each 
and then decide what you want to use. There are other options as well. This is an opportunity to learn a new thing or implement something you always wanted to...so long as it is related to the course in some way. 

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Can we have to work in groups?** No! This game is an individual assignment. 
2. **How much work should this project be?** Not that much! We want you be realistic about what you can accomplish given other time commitments. Implementing a simple game like MP1 using a different engine is fine.
3. **So we have to learn Unity or Godot on our own?** Yes, but there are basic tutorials for each and you only need to implement a simple game.
4. **Can I get help from course staff?** Yes, but not all are staff know Unity and/or Godot. You should post on CampusWire visible to the whole class and we will do our best to help.
5. **Does it have to be a PC game?** No! You can develop for Mobile or VR (Unity would be a good choice) or Web (Godot). If you want to do VR, we can get you access to a Meta Quest 2 to work with.   

### Proposal

The project proposal should be submitted as a link to a Google Doc. That doc link should have edit capability enabled so we can easily comment on the proposal. The proposal should meet the following expectations:
+ No more than 2 pages
+ You describe the following elements of your game. Each one of these should have a separate short paragraph with the title as shown below above the paragraph

+ **Technology** What engine are using for development and what platform are you targeting
+ **Game Genre** What type of game is it?
+ **Space** What is the setting of the game (is it 2D or 3D...etc.).
+ **Goals** What is the player trying to accomplish?
+ **Actors** What are the objects that can be intreacted with or controlled in the game?
+ **Mechanics** What are the actions the actors can perform?
 
**You do not have to wait until you proposal is graded before starting the project!**

## Grading
The proposal and video are graded for completion...the proposal must include all the elements listed above and the video must adequately demonstrate the elements of you game.

The game itself will be graded as follows:
+ 40 points for implmenting a functional game that is demonstrably **your own work**
+ 10 points for creativity...is game not just a copy of an existing game or tutorial
+ 10 points for implementing all the actors listed in the proposal
+ 10 points for implementing all the mechanics in the proposal 

## Sponsored Projects

### Sponsored Project Request Process
To request to work on a sponsored project, post to [CampusWire]() visible only to course staff and using the `Sponsor Request` category. Include the following information:
1. Name and netid of everyone asking to work on the project
2. Which sponsored project you are requesting

We will contact you within a few days of the request to let you know the result of the request.

### List of Sponsored Projects

1. We're offering an opportunity to work on the XR+AI for Empathy Training project at The Grainger College of Medicine as your group project option. This initiative involves developing an XR simulation using Unreal Engine 5 and creating AI-driven characters using GPT models. Even though this project is not a game, it's a fantastic opportunity to be involved in a real-world project for academic research. You'll gain hands-on experience in game development and push the boundaries of XR and AI for empathy training in healthcare and law enforcement.
