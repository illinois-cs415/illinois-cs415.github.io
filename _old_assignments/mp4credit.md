## What is the 4 Credit Project About?
Taking the course for an extra credit hour requires the completion of an extra project in addition to the course project done by the entire class. 
The main focus of the 4 Credit Project will be to implement something using the VR capabilities of Unreal Engine. But there are other options as well.
This is an opportunity to learn a new thing or implement something you always wanted to...so long as it is related to the course in some way. 

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Do we have to work in groups?** No! You can work on your own if you wish.
2. **How big of a group can work in?** There's no limit as long as we decide the proposal is sufficient work for the group size.
3. **Do we have to do a VR project?** No! But you should strongly consider it. It's a chance to work with equipment not everyone has.
4. **What equipment?** We have 9 Oculus Rift S HMDs, and 6 Quest 2 HMDs. These are available in the NCSA 1104 Lab.
5. **What are the non-VR options?** You can propse your own project. Details below.
6. **How much work should this project be?** Not that much! We want you be realistic about what you can accomplish given other tiem commitments. Implementing a simple game like MP1 in VR would be a suitable project for 2 people. 

## VR Projects

Ideally, a VR project will be done as a team (the number of HMDs we have is limited). You can propose your own VR project or consider one of the sponsored projects below. 

### VR Project Proposal

The project proposal should be submitted as a link to a Google Doc. That doc link should have edit capability enabled so we can easily comment on the proposal. The proposal should meet the following expectations:
+ One page or less
+ List all group members by name and netid
+ One paragraph that gives an overview of the project (e.g. "We will implement a VR game in which the player searches for their phone which has fallen next to their car seat while driving.").
+ One paragraph stating what hardware platform you wish to target.
+ A rubric containing specific elements with points assigned that add up to 70 points. This should tell us what the key features are that we will grade. 
+ The rubric should include at least 3 features.
+ One of the features on the rubric should be Using Unreal Engine VR Best Practices and be worth 20 points. You can find the Best Practices guide [at this link](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/XRDevelopment/VR/DevelopVR/ContentSetup). Just to be clear, we will not be super strict about grading this element. You just need to show an a good faith effort to conform to the guidelines.

**Wait until you proposal is graded before starting the project!**

## Sponsored Projects

We have a few opportunities for individuals or teams of people to work with existing groups that have a VR project going. **These projects will be 
available on a first-request basis.** This means that not everyone that requests a sponsored project will for sure get the opportunity to work on it. 

### Sponsored Project Request Process
To request to work on a sponsored project, post to [CampusWire]() visible only to course staff and using the `Sponsor Request` category. Include the following information:
1. Name and netid of everyone asking to work on the project
2. Which sponsored project you are requesting

We will contact you within a few days of the request to let you know the result of the request.

### List of Sponsored Projects

1. Work with PointVR. See their project document here: [PDF](https://github.com/illinois-cs415/illinois-cs415.github.io/raw/main/img/pdf/CS_415_Features_List.pdf). More info about the group can be found here: [PointVR](https://icasu.illinois.edu/outreach/point-vr)

2. Work with NCSA visualizing data from a simulation of a coronal mass ejection (CME) on the sun, optionally combined with a separate, but also cool-looking, animation of convection on the sun's surface.

3. Work with a Civil Engineering research group on developing a VR structural walkthrough of the CIF and other campus buildings.

## Proposing a Non-VR Project ##

If you wish to propose a non-VR project you can do so in same way as a VR project...just without the VR specific elements of the proposal format. 

### Proposal Guidelines
The project proposal should be submitted as a link to a Google Doc. That doc link should have edit capability enabled so we can easily comment on the proposal. The proposal should meet the following expectations:
+ One page or less
+ List all group members by name and netid
+ One paragraph that gives an overview of the project (e.g. "We will implement a non-VR game in which the player searches for their phone which has fallen next to their car seat while driving.").
+ One paragraph stating what hardware platform you wish to target.
+ A rubric containing specific elements with points assigned that add up to 70 points. This should tell us what the key features are that we will grade 
+ The rubric should include at least 3 features.

**Wait until you proposal is graded before starting the project!**
