# Final Project
Your task is to as a team create a video game. Your grade for this project is made up of three major deliverables and team meetings with your assigned project mentor every two weeks. The details, dates, and list of documents to be turned in for each are below.


You can find all document templates needed for the project at the [Course Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G6Jt7JKCdktTcALsBy6WtPQnr2JSAeT5?usp=sharing)


The final project is worth a total of **100 points**. Please see the [detailed rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DL8LW0lQmasXj3AwdqR42hc1X3tRWq48LYYpht-WKB8/edit?usp=sharing) for a better understanding of which portion of these points is graded *per group* and which portion is an *individual score*. The final submission section is subject to course staff discretion based on peer evaluation results. 

## Discovery (10 of points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM Oct 13**

This is the first project milestone. You will submit completed versions of the project documents in the [Final Project Documents Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G6Jt7JKCdktTcALsBy6WtPQnr2JSAeT5?usp=sharing).

The Discovery section is graded on completeness and correctness. Points will be taken off for incorrect submissions (such as missing documents) or for incorrectly filled sections. In particular:
1. Note that each vision canvas section has specific meanings and phrasings. 
2. Try to break down the tasks as much as possible, and consider absolutely everything you may need to implement your vision.
3. The summary should give an idea of what the game *is* and what the player *does*. Avoid explaining implementations or precise technical details. 
4. Initial collaboration plan should clearly describe how you will distribute features and work together on the project including what version control method you will be using. This only needs to be 3 to 5 sentences.

**You can change your design and other plans as the project progresses.** You do not need to go into great detail about how things will be implemented or exhaustively list game features. The most important thing is just to have a vision and a plan that we can discuss.

**For the Technical Design Document and Vision Canvas, you can find example filled out versions in the second tabs of both spreadsheets.**

To reiterate, submission requirements for the Discovery milestone: 
* Project summary
* Vision canvas
* Technical design document
* Collaboration plan

**See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DL8LW0lQmasXj3AwdqR42hc1X3tRWq48LYYpht-WKB8/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed version of the rubric.** Please make sure to look through and understand this at the start of your project. 


## Mid-Project Meeting (10 points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM Oct 27**
Before the Alpha and Final submission due dates, groups will meet with their assigned TAs **one time** to discuss their game design and feedback from the discovery submission. Groups will be graded on:

1. **Attendance.** A majority of group members must attend.
2. **Feedback.** For the meeting, groups should take into consideration feedback given for their Discovery grade. Groups should update their vision canvases, summaries, and technical design documents periodically to reflect this feedback and any changes in design. 
3. **Peer Evaluation Form.** Each team member must individually fill out the midpoint peer evaluation form, found [here](https://forms.gle/zEYFDFUBAfB795ZS6). It is due on Oct 27 by 11:59 PM CT. 

**Week of meetings: Oct 23 - Oct 27**

To reiterate, submission requirements for the Mid-Project milestone: 
* Schedule a Mid-Project meeting with the course staff to receive initial feedback. 
* Project code through a repository or drive/box link
* Mid-Point peer evaluation form, linked above, required per individual. 
* Updated project summary (if applicable based on Discovery milestone feedback) 
* Updated vision canvas (if applicable based on Discovery milestone feedback) 
* Updated technical design document (if applicable based on Discovery milestone feedback) 
* Updated collaboration plan, including details on each team member's contribution so far. See template collaboration plan for more specifications. 


## Alpha (30 points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM Nov 9**

The Alpha submission focuses on the completeness of your game and the implementation of high-priority features. Think of it as a rough draft. We are looking for a demonstration of your gameâ€™s features and gameplay. Visuals, sound, and minor mechanics do not have to be finalized. Additionally, we want groups to update their design documents to reflect the changes made to the game so far.

To reiterate, submission requirements for the Alpha milestone: 
* **Schedule an Alpha milestone meeting with the course staff to live demo your progress and receive feedback.** 
* Project code through a repository or drive/box link
* Updated project summary (if applicable based on Discovery milestone feedback) 
* Updated vision canvas (if applicable based on Discovery milestone feedback) 
* Updated technical design document (if applicable based on Discovery milestone feedback) 
* Updated collaboration plan, including details on each team member's contribution so far. See template collaboration plan for more specifications. 


## Final Submission (45 points)
**Due date: 11:59 PM Dec 6**

Your final project submission. A version of your game with at least all the high priority features done and in a fully playable state. The deliverables for your final submission are the code for the project and a video walking us through the work you have completed. You should also submit an updated version of your discovery documents with any changes you might have made since alpha.

Each team member must individually fill out the final peer evaluation form, found [here](https://forms.gle/sHQyvP7NojV9zDXT7). The form will be due on May 3 by 11:59 PM CT. 

Make sure to look over the detailed rubric, which has been linked on this page, before turning in your final submission. 

To reiterate, submission requirements for the Final Submission milestone: 
* Video demo of game features
* Project code through a repository or drive/box link
* Final peer evaluation form, linked above, required per individual. 
* Updated project summary (if applicable based on Alpha milestone feedback) 
* Updated vision canvas (if applicable based on Alpha milestone feedback) 
* Updated technical design document (if applicable based on Alpha milestone feedback) 
* Updated collaboration plan, including details on each team member's contribution so far. See template collaboration plan for more specifications.
