Hand-in will be done on Canvas. You will be expected to upload the following:

1. A link to a git repo or drive/box folder containing your project code. It should be possible to build your game in Unreal using the submitted code.
2. A short video up to 10 minutes long (can be much shorter) showing your game and demonstrating all the required features. Your video ideally should be a screen capture with brief narration by you pointing out the features as they appear in the game.

Some good options for video capture software are:
+ [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
+ [Game Bar on Windows](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-capture-video-clips-in-windows-10)
+ [QuickTime on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721)

If recording narration is problematic (e.g. you lack a microphone) you can skip that part. Please only resort to capturing video using your phone if you have tried one of the above methods and just could not get it to work. 

On Canvas you should put the link to your code in the Comment box and then upload a video file using the Upload Media tab.
