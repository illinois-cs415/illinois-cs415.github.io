## What is the 4 Credit Project About?
Taking the course for an extra credit hour requires the completion of a substantive extra project in addition to the course project done by the entire class. 
The main focus of the 4 Credit Project will be to implement something using the VR capabilities of Unreal Engine. But there are other options as well.
This is an opportunity to learn a new thing or implement something you always wanted to...so long as it is related to the course in some way. 

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Do we have to work in groups?** No! You can work on your own if you wish.
2. **How big of a group can work in?** There's no limit as long as we decide the proposal is sufficient work for the group size.
3. **Do we have to do a VR project?** No! But you should strongly consider it. It's a chance to work withe equipment not everyone has.
4. **What equipment?** We have 9 Oculus Rift S HMDs, 3 Quest HMDs and 2 Quest 2 HMDs.
5. **What are the non-VR options?** Yes! You can propse your own project. Details Below

## VR Projects

Ideally, a VR project will be done as a team (the number of HMDs we have is limited). You can propose your own VR project or consider one of the sponsored projects below.
Keeping the project simple is fine. 

1. Create a short tutorial on some aspect of using Unreal Engine. This should be in the form of a short video, about 5 to 10 minutes long. It can be on any feature of Unreal. It can be on a topic covered iun class, but it should not simply repeat information already provided in class. In particular, topics in the following categories would good choices:
+ Using AI in Unreal
+ Physics in Unreal
+ Animation in Unreal
+ Developing with C++ in Unreal

2. A project you propose on anything game-related. This should have roughly the same level of complexity and effort at MP1.

### VR Project Proposal

### VR Project Submission

On Canvas, please submit a **zipped** folder the following:
+ Any slides used in the tutorial (or a link to them). I you don't use slides, submit a transcript of your talk.
+ A video file of your tutorial (in mp4 format) or link to the video.
+ Any example code or project used in the tutorial...or a link to them.

### Sposnsored Projects

We have around several opportunities for teams of people to work with existing groups that have a VR project going. **These projects aill be 
available on a first-requrest basis.** This means that not everyone that requests a sponsored will for sure get the opportunity to work on it.
