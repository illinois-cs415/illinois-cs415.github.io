# Where Can I Find a Computer Running Unreal Engine?

You have two options on the University of Illinois campus: the Grainger Library Idea Lab and the 4107 Siebel Center VR Lab.
**In both cases you need to be sure to save your code to a cloud-based repo or some other storage...do not expect that the computers will retain you work after you leave.**

### Grainger Library Idea Lab

The computers in the Idea Lab should be reserved ahead of time. Students can reserve them 24 hours in advance from the website: [idealab.illinois.edu](idealab.illinois.edu). **Lab hours are 10am to 10pm Monday through Friday** 

1.	Click “Reserve a Space”: 
 
2.	You can then reserve a “seat” in any of the following rooms:
•	3D Design Lab
•	3D Digital Scholarship Lab
•	Immersive Learning Lab

3.	When completing a booking form for a seat in one of those rooms, you should make sure to do it at least 24 hours in advance and you should fill out each form field completely, including indicating what software they need. This is important as it help us make sure the software is already installed and is up to date.

4.	In the room reservation pages for the rooms above, they will see an indicator of what VR headsets are installed where, if they happen to need those as well.

5.	Those rooms can also be booked during regular lab hours.

### 4107 Siebel Center Lab

The EWS computers in Siebel Center for Computer Science room 4107 are available for your use in the course. There are 21 computers with Unreal Engine 4 installed. All students in CS 415 have e-lock access to the room and can access the lab anytime the building is open. There is no reservation system, access is first-come first-serve. We will implement a queueing system if it becomes necessary. 

Important note: the lab will close for renovation in late Septemeber but we will relocate the machines elsewhere when that happens.
