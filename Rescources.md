# Where Can I Find a Computer Running Unreal Engine?

You have two options on the University of Illinois campus: the Grainger Library Idea Lab and the Immersive Computing Lab in 1104 NCSA.
**In both cases you need to be sure to save your code to a cloud-based repo or some other storage...do not expect that the computers will retain your work after you leave.**

### Immersive Computing Lab: Room 1104 NCSA

The EWS computers and associated VR equipment in NCSA room 1104 are available for your use in the course. 

#### Equipment 

+ 10 Dell 5280 computers with NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs and Unreal Engine 4 and 5 installed.
+ 3 Oculus Quest HMDs with link cables
+ 3 Meta Quest 2 HMDs with link cables
+ 8 remote access only workstations with NVIDIA RTX 2080 TI GPUs and Unreal Engine 4 and 5 installed 

#### In-person Access 
+ **Noon - Midnight 7 days a week.** All students in CS 415 have e-lock access to the room and building during those hours. 
+ There is no reservation system, access is first-come first-serve. 
+ **The lab may sometimes be reserved and unavailable...these dates will posted on Campuswires and a sign posted outside the lab. Do not enter the lab at those times.**

#### Remote Access

The 8 remote machines can be accessed through [Engineering IT LabCheck](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois.engineering/105329)

### Grainger Library Idea Lab

The computers in the Idea Lab should be reserved ahead of time. Students can reserve them 24 hours in advance from the website: [idealab.illinois.edu](idealab.illinois.edu). **Lab hours are 10am to 10pm Monday through Friday**

1.	Click “Reserve a Space”: 
 
2.	You can then reserve a “seat” in any of the following rooms:
+	3D Design Lab
+	3D Digital Scholarship Lab
+	Immersive Learning Lab

3.	When completing a booking form for a seat in one of those rooms, you should make sure to do it at least 24 hours in advance and you should fill out each form field completely, including indicating what software they need. This is important as it help us make sure the software is already installed and is up to date.

4.	In the room reservation pages for the rooms above, they will see an indicator of what VR headsets are installed where, if they happen to need those as well.

5.	Those rooms can also be booked during regular lab hours.
